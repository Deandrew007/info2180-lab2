         <p>If you’ve been having a hard time trying to get that summer internship, you are not alone. 
             Thousands of University students are actively searching for internships that will offer some
              professional experience in the tech industry. More often than not we all come across developer
               requirements that requires 3-5 years experience. I will try my best to give some pointers on things
                I’ve done and new ways I’m experimenting with, in finding more enjoyable internships. </p>
        
        <h4>Be intentional about what you want.</h4>
        <p>The tech industry in Jamaica is still growing and limited to particular geographics, 
            so you’ll find that there is also limited opportunities. It is also important to realize
             the effects of globalization and try to make it work for you. Now is a good time to do so
              as a lot of tech companies are still accepting Summer Interns. If it is that you’re a
               Software Developer or a Digital creative you should shortlist some companies both locally
                and internationally that you would like to intern at. Set aside a few hours where you’ll
                 just Google away at that list you made. Even if you think you don’t currently fit the criteria,
                  understanding the international market and the required standards can help you in refining
                   the skills and strengths that will put you in-demand. Creating, identifying and generating
                    opportunity requires ongoing investment. Constantly been able to locate professional
                     opportunities builds”opportunity muscle memory” as Reid Hoffman puts it in his book
                      The Start-up of you, great book btw. The more you try, the greater your intuitive 
                      sense of how, why and where opportunities enter your career.</p>
